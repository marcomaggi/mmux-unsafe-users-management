1. Introduction
---------------

This package proposes a model  to manage unsafe user profiles associated
to safe users accounts on  Slackware GNU+Linux systems.  It depends upon
the   Marco's  Bash   Functions   Library  (MBFL),   at  least   version
v3.0.0-devel.8.   This  package expects  the  following  packages to  be
installed: GNU Coreutils, shadow, sudo.

  This package  is meant to  be used on  computers for personal  use, on
which only trusted users have  accounts.  It introduces a security layer
to run  applications under  restricted privileges,  with the  purpose of
partially protect legitimate users from remote attacks.

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.

3. Install
----------

To install from  a proper release tarball, after  unpacking the archive,
do this:

    $ cd mmux-unsafe-users-management-1.0.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

then do it:

    $ ../configure [options] \
       --prefix=/usr
       --sysconfdir=/etc
    $ make
    $ make install

  From  a repository  checkout or  snapshot  (the ones  from the  Github
site): we must  install the GNU Autotools (GNU  Automake, GNU Autoconf),
then  we must  first run  the script  "autogen.sh" from  the top  source
directory, to generate the needed files:

    $ cd mmux-unsafe-users-management
    $ sh autogen.sh

we  should   now  see   the  executable   "configure"  script   and  the
"Makefile.in" file.  From now on everything  is the same as for building
from a proper release tarball, but we have to run the "configure" script
enabling the maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make install

  The  Makefile supports  the  DESTDIR environment  variable to  install
files in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmux-unsafe-users-management

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmux-unsafe-users-management


4. Usage
--------

Read the documentation generated from  the Texinfo sources.  The package
installs the documentation  in Info format; we can  generate and install
documentation in HTML format by running:

   $ make html
   $ make install-html

  This package  relies on "sudo"  to allow user accounts  creation; such
policy is configured by the file:

   /etc/sudoers.d/mmux-unsafe-users-management.conf

which is installed on the system  by this package: do not blindly accept
this configuration  file!  Take  a good  look at  it make  the necessary
changes for your host.

  Remember that such  sudoers file must be installed on  the system with
octal access permissions 0400; the installation directory must also have
octal access permissions 0700.  Such permissions *cannot* be enforced by
the installation infrastructure of this package.

  To enable loading of sudoers configuration modules: we have to include
the following line in the file "/etc/sudoers":

   #includedir /etc/sudoers.d


A. Credits
----------

The  stuff was  written by  Marco Maggi.   If this  package exists  it's
because of the great GNU software tools that he uses all the time.
